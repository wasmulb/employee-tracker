## Description

For this assignment, I developed a command line application that helps employers track there employees. It uses Inquirer for the user to interact with, and SQL for the database. The database has three tables in it. One to track a companies departments, another to track roles, and one table that tracks employees. The user can view any of the tables, add/delete from the tables, and modify an employers role.

From this assignment, I learned a lot. I learned how to use mysql2 to create a database that is easy for the user to interact with. I also learned how to construct a database with multiple tables that are nested. I used JOIN statements to allow for tables to display data that includes data from other tables in the database.
